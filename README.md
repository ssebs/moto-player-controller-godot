# Moto Player Controller

Motorcycle Player Controller (+ bike and world) written in Godot 4. Originally created for [Dank Nooner](https://github.com/ssebs/DankNooner), this is the motorcycle + controls + driving physics implementation.

## In Progress:
- [ ] Custom "bike_handler" physics update function - instead of calling handleX and handleY in physics on player_controller, call 1 func that does all of that.
- [ ] Fix IK
- [ ] Fix bugs / understand the code
  - [x] Merge bike_steering & bike_physics
  - [x] Cleanup player controller
  - [ ] Fix lean / tip in / steering feeling
  - [ ] Fix brake slam / crashing

## TODO:

- [ ] Tweak values til they feel good

  - [ ] Gearing / speed
  - [ ] rpm / sound
  - [x] Steering at low speeds
  - [ ] falling at low speeds (fix idle tip in)
  - [ ] wheelie / stoppie control

- [ ] User stories:

  - [ ] bike should fall when too slow
  - [ ] bike should lean up when accelerating
  - [ ] bike should tip-in / countersteer when leaning
  - [ ] the steer angle + lean angle should be based on speed
  - [ ] crash detection and respawn
  - [x] wheelies / stoppies - pitch control during each
  - [x] Skidding / fishtail - rear brake skids, fishtail drift physics w/ skidmarks
  - [x] engine sound pitch based on RPM
  - [x] tire screech on skids/stoppies
  - [x] gear grind sound
  - [x] gear display, speedometer, throttle bar (with redline color), brake danger bar
  - [x] Controller vibration - brake danger, fishtail, redline

- [ ] Create rigged character
- [ ] Animate character
- [ ] Complex movement / input system
  - [ ] State machine
  - [ ] Sync'd animations
  - [ ] tricks
  - [ ] Ragdoll
- [ ] if the front tire skids and regains traction, the bike should porpoise. causing a high-side crash.

## Done:

- [x] Cleanup / refactor vibe coded `player_controller.gd`
  - [x] Move to its own node/script
- [x] Basic Movement / input system
  - [x] throttle / brake
  - [x] lean
  - [x] clutch / gears
  - [x] crashing (fall off bike, collision)
- [x] Basic sounds
- [x] Skidmarks / drifts
- [x] Import motorcycle 3d model
- [x] Create basic world
- [x] Create godot project
- [x] Control map:

## Notes copied from ../README.md

### To implement

- Basic controls / movement (gas, steer, brake, cluch?, gears?)
- State machine to sync animations to movement state
- Riding bike Animations (lean/steer, wheelie, start/stop w/ leg down)
- Sync'd animations w/ state machine

### Goals

- Animations
  - IK to animate to hold on to handlebars / lean
  - Ragdoll when you fall off
- Mechanics
  - Fun but challenging
    - Multiple difficult levels
      - **Easy** - Automatic, can't fall off bike unless crashing
      - **Medium** - Manual, can't fall easily from mistakes (e.g. lowside)
      - **Hard** - Manual, can fall (e.g. low side crash if leaning and grabbing a fist full of brake)
  - Manage clutch, balancing, throttle, steering (need to be smooth, don't just slam it.)
  - Falling / crashing has ragdoll physics, player goes flying until they stop moving (or press btn)
- Gameplay
  - Doing wheelies gives you NOS
